Purpose
- Platform to plan and execute spray-painting tasks with a 6-DOF robotic arm. Includes ROS 2 packages for safety, path generation and UR simulation, calibration tooling and example trajectory output for validation.

Status & composition
- Active development for Arise Project (RAPSEB Subgrant).
- Languages: Python, C++, CMake. ROS 2 workspace present at `ros2_ws/`.

Quick facts discovered in the repository
- ROS 2 packages under ros2_ws/src/:
  - rapseb_hri_safety
    - Node/script: `ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety/hri_safety_guard.py`
    - Launch: `ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety/launch/hri_safety_guard.launch.py`
  - spraying_pathways
  - ur_simulation_gazebo
- Example/recorded trajectory: `ros2_ws/trajectory_output.csv`
- Docker environment files present under a Dockerfile directory at the repo root.

Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (match to your ROS 2 distro)
- ROS 2 (Foxy / Galactic / Humble — use the distro you have installed)
- Python 3.8+
- colcon and colcon-common-extensions
- build-essential, CMake >= 3.10, Eigen, Boost and vendor SDKs (EtherCAT/CAN/serial) where required
- Docker

ROS 2 — build and run 

1. Source system ROS 2 environment
- Replace `<ros2-distro>` with your installed distro ( humble is our default )
```bash
source /opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/setup.bash
```

2. Build the workspace
```bash
cd ros2_ws
# build with symlink install for iterative development
colcon build --symlink-install
```

3. Source the workspace
```bash
# after build, in every shell where you run nodes
source install/setup.bash
```

4. Confirm packages
```bash
colcon list
# expected to list at minimum:
# rapseb_hri_safety       ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety
# spraying_pathways       ros2_ws/src/spraying_pathways
# ur_simulation_gazebo    ros2_ws/src/ur_simulation_gazebo
```

5. Run the provided safety launch (exact, discovered launch file)
```bash
# runs the HRI safety guard launch discovered in the repo
ros2 launch rapseb_hri_safety hri_safety_guard.launch.py
```

6. Discover other executables and launch files (use these commands to get exact names)
```bash
# list executables declared for a package (replace <package>)
ros2 pkg executables <package>

# list launch files in a package's launch directory
ls -la ros2_ws/src/<package>/launch
```

Example workflow (build + run safety guard)
```bash
# example session
source /opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/setup.bash
cd ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch rapseb_hri_safety hri_safety_guard.launch.py
```

Notes on running nodes directly
- If a package exposes executables via its setup/ament configuration, use:
```bash
ros2 run <package> <executable> [--ros-args --params-file <params.yaml>]
```
- If a script is not installed as an entry point, you can run it directly for quick inspection, but ensure you source ROS 2 and set PYTHONPATH appropriately:
```bash
# for debugging only (prefer ros2 run / ros2 launch for deployment)
source /opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/setup.bash
python3 ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety/hri_safety_guard.py
```
(Running the script directly may require additional environment variables or package setup; prefer the installed entry point.)

Non-ROS (native C++/CMake) build (if present)
- Generic out-of-source build pattern (root CMakeLists.txt or other CMake targets):
```bash
# top-level repository, if a standard CMake build is present
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . -- -j$(nproc)

# locate produced executables
find . -type f -perm -111 -maxdepth 6 -print
```
- Install:
```bash
cmake --install . --prefix ../install
../install/bin/<executable> --config ../configs/<config>.yaml
```
# inside container:
source /opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/setup.bash
cd /workspace/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch rapseb_hri_safety hri_safety_guard.launch.py
```

Configuration, params and calibration
- Use ROS 2 parameter YAML files and pass them via `--ros-args --params-file <file>.yaml` when running nodes or in launch files.
- Place robot kinematics, joint limits and spray parameters in `configs/` (create this directory if not present).
- Use provided calibration or path-generation scripts in the workspace packages (look under `ros2_ws/src/*/tools` or `ros2_ws/src/*/scripts`).

Files of interest
- `ros2_ws/trajectory_output.csv` — recorded trajectory data useful for verification and replay.
- `ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety/hri_safety_guard.py` — HRI safety guard node.
- `ros2_ws/src/rapseb_hri_safety/launch/hri_safety_guard.launch.py` — Launch file to start the safety guard.

Testing & validation
- ROS 2 integration: create launch that starts controllers + mock hardware; then run end-to-end test.
- Python tests: `pytest` from the repo root if tests exist.
- C++ tests: run `ctest` from the native build directory.

Operational safety
- Always keep hardware E-stop enabled during commissioning.
- Validate collision maps and enforce joint/Cartesian velocity & acceleration limits.
- Use PPE and ventilation when operating spray equipment.

Contributing
- Fork -> branch feature/<short-desc> -> PR with tests and changelog entry. Include simulation logs or recorded trajectories where behavior changes are non-trivial.

Notes
- I inspected the repository to locate ROS 2 packages and a safety launch file and inserted exact ROS 2 build and run commands that use those package and launch names. Use the discovery commands in the "Discover other executables" section to obtain other package executables and available launch files and substitute them into the examples above.
